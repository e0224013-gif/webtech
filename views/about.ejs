        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Cardiovascular diseases are a leading cause of mortality worldwide. Electrocardiography (ECG) records heart
            electrical activity and is essential for diagnosing arrhythmias.</p>

        <h3>Why ECG + AI</h3>
        <p>Automated ECG analysis with AI can assist clinicians by providing fast, consistent, and scalable screening
            for arrhythmias, reducing time-to-diagnosis and supporting remote healthcare.</p>

        <h3>Model Architecture (CNN + LSTM)</h3>
        <p>The hybrid architecture uses 1D convolutional layers to extract spatial/local features from raw ECG waveforms
            followed by LSTM layers to capture temporal dependencies across beats. Convolutions act as learned filters
            extracting morphological patterns, while LSTM models sequence-level dynamics, improving detection of
            transient anomalies.</p>
