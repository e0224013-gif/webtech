        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>This project demonstrates a pipeline for ECG arrhythmia classification using a hybrid 1D-CNN + LSTM
            architecture. AI-assisted ECG analysis can significantly aid clinicians by flagging abnormal rhythms and
            providing confidence scores for triage.</p>
        <p>While this web demo provides mock predictions, a full implementation would include trained models, validation
            on diverse datasets, and deployment with regulatory considerations.</p>
